This tool is designed for packaging Minecraft Bedrock Addons in a quick and easy way.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS TOOL IS STILL WIP AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS. REPORT ANY BUGS YOU FIND SO I CAN EASILY TRACK THEM! THANK YOU!

This is a GUI-based tool, so using it should be intuitive to most people. When you open the ui, use the menu bar > Configuration > Packs > To select the pack you wish to package. Packs must be defined in config.json, which will be created for you when the tool is first run.
